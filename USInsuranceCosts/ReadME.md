<h1>Does an individual's BMI affect their Medical Insurance Costs in the US?</h1>

<h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
I hypothesise that it will, as I think that a person's BMI is a measure of how 'healthy' they are and I feel as though they may be charged more due to being 'unhealthy' as the thought process may be 'You wouldn't need medical help if you were healthier'? So goes the saying 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away'. I think that a person with a BMI above 25 will be higher as they will be categorized as overweight, and I think the people with BMI under 18.4 will be higher as they will be categorized as underweight and so would require medical help in that sense.

<h3>Data Set:</h3>
The data set used is from https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance and documents US citizens: age, sex, BMI, number of children they have, whether they smoke or not, what region their from and what they were charged. I will be mainly looking at BMI and how much they were charged, although a person's health risk due to being 'unhealthy' is based on the persons BMI, age, sex and height. I will just be looking at any correlations between BMI and how much their Medical Insurance costs.

<h3>Sample Size:</h3>
I will be taking a sample size of 300 due to a population of 1338 from the data set, a confidence level of 95%, a Margin of Error of 5% and expected proportion of 0.5.

<h3>Sampling Method:</h3>
I plan to use systematic sampling to take the 300 data sample, in order to remove bias and due to my own PC's limitations.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
I will be treating everyone as equals, men and women will be treated equally as well as other aspects such as income. I am purely looking into an individuals BMI and how much their medical insurance cost is. I will only be separating people into their respective BMI ranges of: underweight, healthy, overweight, obese. We must also remember and take into account the fact that an individuals BMI isn't the only factor taken into account when calculating their insurance cost, many other factors will probably be taken into account such as whether they smoke or not, etc..

<h3>Findings:</h3>
I have discovered that in my sample there are:

<h4>Underweight People:</h4>
  - 8 Underweight people in the sample. <br>
  - Have a mean Medical Insurance Cost of $9268.36 <br>
  - Have a standard deviation of $10300.16 <br>
  - The Lowest cost is $1694.80 <br>
  - The Highest cost is $32734.19 <br>

<h4>Healthy People:</h4>
  - 54 Healthy weight people in the sample. <br>
  - Have a mean Medical Insurance Cost of $10199.13 <br>
  - Have a standard deviation of $7353.16 <br>
  - The Lowest is $1121.87 <br>
  - The Highest was $27375.90 <br>

<h4>Overweight People:</h4>
 - 87 Overweight people in the sample. <br>
 - Have a mean Medical Insurance Cost of $11357.33 <br>
 - Have a standard deviation of $8858.26 <br>
 - The Lowest is $1615.77 <br>
 - The Highest is $38245.59 <br>

<h4>Obese People:</h4>
 - 151 Obese people in the sample. <br>
 - Have a mean Medical Insurance Cost of $14308.77 <br>
 - Have a standard deviation of $13446.49 <br>
 - The Lowest is $1131.51 <br>
 - The Highest is $48885.14 <br>


<h3>Comparisons and Analysis of Findings:</h3>
 There is clearly a lot more people in the sample who are above the healthy BMI which shows that the population is generally 'larger'. There are 246 out of 300 people, who are not in the healthy BMI range which means 82% of the population is 'unhealthy'.

 There seems to be an exponential growth across the insurance costs going up through the BMI Ranges. From underweight to healthy there is an increase of $930.77. From Healthy to Overweight there is an increase of $1158.20. From overweight to obese there is an increase of $2951.44. So we can identify that there are similar but growing changes from underweight to healthy to overweight, but from overweight to obese there a definite large increase in costs.

 The healthy people were the least spread out in their costs due to having the lowest standard deviation. The obese people were the most spread out in their costs due to having the highest standard deviation.

 The Lowest costs don't seem to correlate to BMI, however with the highest we can see a drop of $5358.29 from underweight to healthy, then an increase of $10869.69 from healthy to overweight, then a further increase of $10639.55. This doesn't seem to provide much insight though.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
 We can conclude from the research done on this sample that there are clearly lots of people who aren't within the healthy range of BMI's this may be coincidental and may not reflect the entire US population, but there was 246 people out of the 300 person sample who were not in the healthy BMI range, which is 82% of the population, which is definitely not only ver concerning, but also very interesting as I personally never thought the situation was that bad in the US.

 It becomes tricky to exactly say that 'Yes BMI directly effects insurance costs', as there will likely be many other factors in an individuals life which effects their insurance costs. However, I would still conclude that a higher BMI generally increases your insurance cost, as we can see the means are exponetially increasing as BMI increases, which would quite strongly suggest that your BMI has an effect on your insurance cost.

 From my perspective the standard deviations and highest and lowest costs, do not provide much insight and only gives small hints to things, but there doesn't seem to be any concrete information. Perhaps I should look into more measures or look at another sample.

 From the work done here, there simply isn't enough evidence to solidly conclude any findings. Therefore, I will not be making specific judements as to whether someone's BMI effects their insurance costs. Thank you for your time.
