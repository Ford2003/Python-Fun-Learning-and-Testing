# Python-Fun-Learning-and-Testing
Just for me to share the programmes I create in Python as well as getting used to the way github works :)

This page will be for explaining each programme I upload as well as any prerequisites and information for using them. Enjoy!


LinearRegression.py is available and is my first actual program which features an easy method of linear regression, you're very welcome to download or copy it to try or edit for yourself. :)
Some Details: 
-It reads through the data points set by the user in the program in the 'Dataset' list near the top of the code and finds a line of best fit which minimises the difference of all the y-values, and the line, in the data.
-It works by trial and error to minimise the error, the line of best fit is in the format y = mx + b and so systematically goes through m and b values and returns the best set.
-m is in the range -10 to 10 in 0.1 steps. b is in the range -20 to 20 in steps of 0.1. Therefore, results and accuracy is limited to 1 decimal place and users of the program should be aware of this.
